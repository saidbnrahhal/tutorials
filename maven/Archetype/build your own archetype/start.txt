Building our own archetype:
1 : we need simple maven project that we want to torn it into archetype
	in generating the project use name of group id and artifact id carefully because you gonna use it after .
2 : we use the command 
	>mvn archetype:creat-from-project
	 we can see after the command a archetype folder under 
	 target : target >generated-sources-archetype>archetype
	 you can see also that in the pom of the generated archetype we have 
	 the type of packaging is a maven-archetype
3 : installing the archetype to our local repository
	>cd  target/generated-sources-archetype/archetype
	>maven install 
4 : using the new archetype 
    >first-archetype-template
    you can use a different group id  and artifact id .
