owning side is most often, if not always, where the @JoinColumn annotation must be specified
the owning side will have foreign key in his table that represent the inverse side.
the inverse  "non-owning" side use mappedBy .
@OneToMany(mappedBy="series") can be used in the inverse side.
If the relationship is unidirectional there really isn't an owning side,
and there isn't any mappedBy annotations.
 For ManyToOne there is no mappedBy so the entity specified under the OneToMany annotation that owns the relationship.
 Cascading from Child to Parent is not very useful and usually, itâ€™s a mapping code smell.
